# Goal

- - -

Skyll is intended to help make autoring levels to 2/2.5d platformers easier.

The idea is that Skyll will do this by handling the grunt work of carving a path,
placing ground blocks & obstacles, and positioning enemies & collectables -
allowing designers to focus on higher level concerns like what types of collectables,
enemies, and obstacles to include as well as the difficulty, rhythm, and flow
of the level.

Curretly Skyll is extrenely basic - it only carves a path through a grid of
available blocks. It is also only usable as an executable.

In the near future Skyll will be usable via the `skyll` executable as well as the
`skyll` module which may be required and used like any other node module.
